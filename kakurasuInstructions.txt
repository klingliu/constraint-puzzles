Welcome to Kakurasu!

The goal is to make some of the cells black in such a way that:
1. The black cells on each row sum up to the number on the right.
2. The black cells on each column sum up to the number on the bottom.
3. If a black cell is first on its row or column, then its value is 1. If it is second its value is 2, etc.
