# constraintPuzzles

This project implements three constraint puzzles, Hitori, Kakurasu, and Skyscraper, within a swing program. The user can play the games, check their solutions, and ask for a loaded grid of the solution itself. As of right now, loading the solution does not work on Skyscraper, but the other puzzles work smoothly.
